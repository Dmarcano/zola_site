## Background

Hi! My name is Diego Marcano, a Senior Software Engineer at Meta Platform Inc. I've worked both on infrastructure and full stack roles and today primarily work on the product privacy and security for every single of Meta's Family of Apps.

My main interests outside of work lie in both software and physical engineering. I like using Rust in both web and embedded projects.
